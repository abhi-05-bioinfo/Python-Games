This is the python code for the game stone-paper-scissors we use to play in our childhood.
When you run the code it shows you three options (i.e. stone, paper and scissors) on the screen.
You have to type the option of your choice in the given space.
Make sure you type the same spelling given in the option.
Then press enter. It will immediately show you the score of that particular round and take you to the next round.
You will have 3 chances and based upon the total it will show you if you have won or the computer has won or the game is a draw.
After that you'll exit the game.
